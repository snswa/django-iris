Now visit URLs for users in separate browser tabs or windows to experiment.

Visit http://localhost:8080/iris/ to view the anonymous user experience.

Visit http://localhost:8000/iris/?u=alice to simulate signing in as the user
"alice".  Other users include "bob", "carla", and "doug".

Be sure to look at iris.example.backends.ContrivedBackend to see an
example of restricting the viewing of individual topics by users based
on arbitrary criteria.
